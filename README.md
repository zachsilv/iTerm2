This is a fork of <a href="https://iterm2.com">iTerm2</a> by <a href="http://www.aljex.com">Aljex Software Inc.</a>

The differences from upstream iTerm2 are:

* Adds ENQ answerback string, currently hard coded to "Aljex_iTerm2\n".
* Adds OSC 200 escape sequence to launch urls & files.
* Built-in emulation defaults configured for Aljex.

The ultimate purpose of this fork is to provide a Mac OSX version of <a href="http://www.aljex.com/misc/Aljex_Client_7.5.6.exe">Aljex Client PRO</a>, based on iTerm2 in the same way that <a href="http://github.com/aljex/aljex-client">AljexTerminal</a> is based on <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>.
